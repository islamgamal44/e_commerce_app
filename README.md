# The code Improvement Challenge
  The idea behind the competition is to improve your Flutter development skills within a set period in a group of other enthusiasts. The challenge will last for a week when everyone can propose a code improvement for the app we build and submit it with a pull request.

Improvements:

1- Widgets. We have quite a few widgets to developed already that can be improved. The is an Easter Egg right in the article with a widget description. What you can do is optimize current widgets and their usage.

2- Bloc improvements. Things connected to events, states and Bloc can be revised as well. Read more on that in Flutter Bloc.

3- Flutter clean architecture implementation and improvements. You can do in this part updates for data or domain part of the app. You can find more info about Flutterâ€™s clean architecture here.

...any other propositions on code or architecture improvements.
